<p style="font-family:Helvetica" style="text-align:center;">Lil Tracy was born Jazz Butler to two parents who knew their way around music. His father is Ishmael Butler, of Shabazz Palaces fame. His mother is Coko Clemons, who is well known as a member of popular 90s R&amp;B group SWV. He grew up in Virginia Beach, where he would listen to the emo music and southern hip-hop that inspired his music. At a young age his parents split up, and so he was forced to bounce between his mother and father's homes. He started making music at 15 under the name "Persian Dolphin". He attended high school in Seattle, Washington until he was 17, at which point he chose to be homeless and dropped out. At 18, he moved to Los Angeles to focus on his music career as well as the ease of living for the homeless.
